# Singly Linked List Midpoint Finder

## Introduction
This Kotlin code demonstrates how to find the midpoint of a singly linked list without counting the elements or retrieving the size of the list. It defines a class named `Solution1` with a `midpoint` function to accomplish this task.

## Code Explanation
The code is structured as follows:

### Class Definition
- The `Solution1` class is defined to encapsulate the logic for finding the midpoint.
- It contains a companion object with a `midpoint` function.

### `midpoint` Function
- The `midpoint` function takes a singly linked list as input and returns the midpoint node.
- Two pointers, `slowPointer` and `fastPointer`, are initialized to the first node of the list.
- The code uses a while loop to traverse the linked list efficiently.
- `slowPointer` advances one step at a time, while `fastPointer` advances two steps at a time.
- When `fastPointer` reaches the end of the list or the last node, `slowPointer` will be at the midpoint.
- The midpoint node is returned as the result.

## Usage
To use this code, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download this repository.

2. Ensure you have Kotlin installed on your system.

3. Create a Kotlin project and add the provided Kotlin code to your project.

4. Use the `Solution1` class to find the midpoint of a singly linked list as shown in the example below:

```kotlin
val solution = Solution1()
val l = SinglyLinkedList<Char>()
// Populate the linked list...
val result = solution.midpoint(l)
This code allows you to find the midpoint of a singly linked list without counting the elements or retrieving the size of the list, making it an efficient solution for various applications.
